    <context>
    You are assisting a legal team representing the Fenoscadia Limited, a large mining company doing its activities in Republic of Kronos. Fenoscadia and Kronos have signed a concession agreement allowing it to exploit a site in Kronos for 80 years.

    In 2015, Kronos passed a new Environmental Act (KEA), requiring companies to protect local waters from toxic waste. In 2016, following a government-funded university study suggesting that Fenoscadiaâ€™s work may have contaminated the Rhea River (Kronos' main water source), Kronos issued Presidential Decree No. 2424. This decree revoked Fenoscadiaâ€™s license, terminated the concession agreement, and banned lindoro exploitation altogether.

    A dispute arose.

    Fast forward to the middle of the arbitration proceedings, Kronos is seeking to file an environmental counterclaim against Fenoscadia during arbitration proceedings, alleging:

    Contamination of the Rhea River due to graspel, a toxic component released during mining;

    Health impacts, including increased cardiovascular disease rates;

    Costs of cleanup, alternative water supplies, and healthcare, estimated at USD 150 million.

    An environmental counterclaim is essentially the host stateâ€™s legal response claiming that the investor caused environmental damage, such as pollution or deforestation. The state uses this counterclaim to avoid paying compensation for the investorâ€™s original claims of unfair treatment and losses.

    ðŸ‘‰ The legal teamâ€™s mission is to prepare a closing statement for Fenoscadia, aimed at persuading the tribunal to reject the environmental counterclaim.

    # You are a legal advisor for Triton Spire Industries, a multinational energy company specializing in deep-sea resource extraction. In 2012, Triton Spire signed a 50-year agreement with the Republic of Aethelgard to build and operate a massive floating platform to harvest rare-earth minerals from a deep-ocean trench within Aethelgard's exclusive economic zone.

    # In 2020, Aethelgard passed a new Marine Heritage and Preservation Act (MHPA), which designated certain marine habitats as protected zones. Shortly after, a government-sponsored scientific expedition discovered a unique species of bioluminescent coral near Triton Spireâ€™s platform. Following this, the President of Aethelgard issued a decree, Presidential Edict No. 1991, revoking Triton Spire's permits, terminating the concession agreement, and prohibiting all deep-sea resource extraction in its waters.

    # A dispute arose, leading to an international arbitration.

    # Fast forward to the arbitration proceedings. Aethelgard has filed a counterclaim against Triton Spire, alleging:

    # Destruction of a pristine marine ecosystem and an uncatalogued species of coral due to Triton Spire's sonic drilling operations.

    # Irreversible damage to the ocean floor, impacting the entire food chain in the region.

    # Costs for a 20-year ecological restoration project, including a scientific research fund and reparations to local fishing communities, estimated at USD 250 million.

    # This environmental counterclaim is a legal maneuver by the host state to argue that the investor's actions caused significant ecological damage. By doing so, the state aims to avoid paying compensation for the investorâ€™s original claims, such as wrongful termination of the contract and lost profits.

    # ðŸ‘‰ Your legal teamâ€™s mission is to prepare a persuasive closing statement for Triton Spire, arguing that the tribunal should reject Aethelgard's environmental counterclaim.

    # Example Prompt for the AI:
    # I'm advising Triton Spire Industries, an energy company from the Federated Republics of Valerion, on an arbitration case against the Republic of Aethelgard. We had a 50-year agreement to extract deep-sea minerals, but Aethelgard terminated it with Presidential Edict No. 1991, citing environmental concerns over a newly discovered bioluminescent coral. Aethelgard's government claims our sonic drilling operations destroyed the ecosystem and is now seeking a USD 250 million counterclaim for restoration and research.

    # Can you help me analyze how to challenge Aethelgardâ€™s environmental counterclaim, specifically by focusing on issues of jurisdiction, admissibility, and the merits of their claims?
